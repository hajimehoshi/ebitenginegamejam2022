SPACE AGE is an original font based on the logotype for Epcot's "Mission: Space" attraction. Version 1.0 contains capitals, alternate capitals, numerals, most punctuation, and some extended characters.

Space Age is included in Windows TrueType format as well as the newer cross-platform OpenType format. Windows 2000/XP and Mac OS X support OpenType fonts natively. Earlier versions require Adobe Type Manager Light, a free download:

The OpenType version also contains many built-in ligatures. These are available to OpenType-aware applications that support the 'liga' feature (ie. some recent Adobe products).


SPECIAL CHARACTERS
------------------
The tilde and underscore characters contain horizontal lines useful for creating ligatures.
To create a ligature connected at the top, use the tilde character ~ (example: s~p).
To create a ligature connected at the bottom, use the underscore character _ (example: c_s).
